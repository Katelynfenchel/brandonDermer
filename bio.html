		<h1>Biography</h1>
	<div class='container'>


		<p class= "bio"> Chicago native Brandon Dermer always wanted to be Michael Jordan - that is, until he realized he was terrible at basketball.  Fortunately, that harsh reality had no effect on his lifelong love of sports, which he channeled into his eventual PLAN B: directing TV, music videos and commercials. </p>

		<p class="bio"> Growing up, Dermer constantly created video content with his friends.  He played in bands throughout junior high and high school, leading him to experiment with music videos.  After graduating from Columbia College Chicago with a Bachelor of Arts in film studies, he jumped headfirst into the professional filmmaking world.  In 2011, he released his first critical hit: "Fleshlightning," a comedy short about a man discovering a magical sex toy.  He has since collaborated with a span of networks and brands, including MTV, Comedy Central, Adult Swim, Viceland, EA Games, Mutual Omaha, among others; as well as top industry artists such as Major Lazer, Dillon Francis, and Panic! At the Disco. </p>

		<p class= "bio"> In lieu of sticking with a particular filmmaking style, Dermer prefers to instead focus on maintaining consistency.  Whether it be tone, aesthetic, or absurdity - once he commits, he sees the concept through, allowing him to helm projects that resonate with a variety of audiences.  Dermer is perhaps best known for What Would Diplo Do, a comedy television series starring James Van Der Beek as a fictionalized version of the real-life Grammy award-winning DJ, Diplo.  The mockumentary premiered - co-created, executive produced, and directed by Dermer - premiered on Viceland in 2017 to great acclaim, earning high praise from Variety, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The LA Times, Rolling Stone, IndieWire and more. </p>

		<p class= "bio"> Dermer's innovative music videos have garnered millions of views online, Vimeo Staff Picks, and press highlights by major publications including The Huffington Post, Rolling Stone, AV Club, and Vulture, to name a few.  His 2012 music video for Nekrogoblikon's "No One Survives" catapulted the little-known death metal band to the front page of Reddit.  The gory music video - which features a goblin's plight for love - went on to screen at the 2014 SXSW Film Festival.  Dermer made waves with his steamy video for Dillon Francis' "Not Butter," which poked fun at the often challenging relations between a music video's corporate and creative halves.  The video played at Ibiza Music Video Film Festival, won Video of the Year at the 2016 Berlin Music Video Festival, and was named one of Vimeo's top 5 Staff Picks at SXSW 2016.  In 2016, Dermer spearheaded the MTV VMA-nominated music video for Panic! At The Disco's "Victorious."  To date, the video's positive sequence of fantastical victories has surpassed 50 million views. </p>

		<p class= "bio"> Currently, Dermer has a handful of music videos on the horizon to premiere.  He is also spearheading several television projects - all in various stages of development - with various networks and studios. </p>
